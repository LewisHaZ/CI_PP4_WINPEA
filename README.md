## Design

### Colours

The Winpea brand is a black and white design so for the site I kept with the brighter but simple feel to the sites design.
Upon doing some market research on other brands I was able to discern that simple colour palettes are usually favoured in
the design of Fashion websites.

Colours used include white, grey, black and a light/darker shade of blues for the footer.

### Fonts

Fonts were taken from Google Fonts; I used Playfair Display with sans serif as a backup.
